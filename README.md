# Phyllotactic Pattern Generator
This is a command line tool for generating different phyllotactic patterns.  This project is in a very early stage and so far the following patterns can be generated:
    - Vogel planar patterns

## Requirements

## Usage
The tool is used from the command line as follows
'''
python.exe ./src/python.exe PATTERN [OPTIONS]
'''
PATTERN is an integer indicating which kind of pattern we wish to implement.  Each PATTERN has certain required numerical inputs, as follows.

PATTERN 0: generate a Vogel planar pattern using n florets with a scaling factor c
